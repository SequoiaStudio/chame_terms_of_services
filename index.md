<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sequoia Studios is a service provider of transitory digital network communications under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") 17 U.S.C. p. 512(a). Accordingly, it is Sequoia Studios's policy to promptly terminate without notice the accounts of those determined by Sequoia Studios to be repeat infringers, where a repeat infringer is an end user of the Sequoia Studios Services who has been notified by Sequoia Studios of infringing transmissions activities more than twice ("Repeat Infringer Policy"). Because of the ephemeral nature of transmissions imitated at the direction of persons using the Sequoia Studios Service, it is generally not possible for Sequoia Studios to take-down content from its system, but it will use all reasonable efforts to identify the offending persons in order to enforce its Repeat Infringer Policy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.</span></p>
